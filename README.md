## Hi there 👋
About Me – Randeep Singh
I’m Randeep Singh, a tech enthusiast and creative storyteller, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) with a strong focus on application development and AI-driven solutions.

💻 Tech & Programming – Skilled in C/C++, JavaScript, and familiar with Python, I build robust full-stack applications using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and API integrations. My project MoodGroov blends machine learning with a dynamic UI to create personalized music playlists.

🧠 AI & Prompt Engineering – Specialized in ChatGPT prompt creation, AI monetization strategies, AI image/video generation, and natural language processing concepts, turning AI into real-world revenue streams.

🎨 Creative & UI Design – Designer of intuitive, Apple Music–style dark dashboards, responsive websites, and branded visuals. I also create viral Instagram Reels, trending meme-based content, and strategic content calendars for D2C and wellness brands.

🎥 Scriptwriting & Storytelling – Writer of intense Punjabi historical vlogs in Theth Malwai dialect with cinematic depth, blending history with cultural pride.

🎧 Music & Content Creation – Producer of Punjabi hip-hop beats infused with Egyptian instrumental fusion, and author of the premium eBook “100 Ways to Make Money with ChatGPT”.

🌱 Beyond Tech – Experienced in research writing, creative guides, and freelance digital services including logo design, video editing, and social media management for global clients.

📍 Based in Mohali, I merge technology, creativity, and cultural storytelling to craft impactful digital experiences.
